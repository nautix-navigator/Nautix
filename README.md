# Boat Boundary Alert System ðŸŒŠ

This project helps detect whether a boat is inside or outside a defined boundary on a map. It uses GPS location to determine the boat's position and alerts the user with a buzzer sound if the boundary is crossed.

## Features
- Live GPS location tracking.
- Boundary visualization on a map.
- Buzzer alert when crossing the boundary.
- Manual location selection for testing.
- Toggle for enabling or disabling the buzzer.

## How to Use
1. Open the webpage on a browser that supports geolocation (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
2. Grant location permissions when prompted.
3. View your live location on the map.
4. Check if you are within or outside the predefined boundary.
5. Use the toggle button to turn the buzzer alert on or off.
